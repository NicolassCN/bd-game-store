# Database Project
### Nova University of Lisbon

## Digital Game Distribution Platform

### Description
This project consists of creating a database for an online/offline platform that offers management of a digital game library, with an integrated store and social tools. The platform allows users to browse, obtain information about each game, users, and companies at any time. Users can also purchase games, add them to their library, and interact with other users. The platform also allows companies to manage their games and interact with users.

### Additional Documentation
Additional project documentation, including the conceptual model of the database, entity-relationship diagrams, SQL scripts, and implementation details, can be found in the "docs" folder of this repository.
